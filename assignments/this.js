/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Object Binding
        The value of 'this' will be to the window/console Object
* 2. Implicit Binding
        The value of 'this' is bound to what is left of the dot
* 3. New Binding
        The value of 'this' is bound to specific instance of the object (variable) that is created and returned by the constructor function that was invoked.
        This is indicated by the use of 'new'
* 4. Explicit Binding
*       The value of 'this' is bound to the new object you're pointing it to through a function method such as .bind .call or .apply
* write out a code example of each explanation above
